## Usage

A `Locker` is a queue where items in the queue can either require an exclusive or non-exclusive lock on some resource.

Items are provided as promise-returning functions.

### Creating a Locker

```js
var Locker = require('lock-queue');

var locker = new Locker();
```

### Adding an item to the queue

```js
var promise = locker.run(fn, ctx);
```

* `fn` is the function to be executed
* `ctx` is the `this` context to execute the function with
* Return value is a Promise which will resolve/reject with the value/reason that the function resolves/rejects with

### Adding an item to the queue which requires an exclusive lock

```js
var promise = locker.lock(fn, ctx);
```

### Execution order

* Items in the queue are executed in the order that they are added.
* Items requiring a non-exclusive lock run concurrently.
* When the next item in the queue requires an exclusive lock, all currently running items are awaited before the exclusive item begins execution.
* All other items are then held in the queue until the exclusive-lock function has finished.
* When the exclusive-lock function has finished, the rest of the queue begins processing again.

### Example

```js
var Locker = require('lock-queue');
var locker = new Locker();

// Non-exclusive lock functions
locker.run(function A() {
	console.log('A start');
	return Promise.resolve();
}).then(function() {
	console.log('A finish');
});

locker.run(function B() {
	console.log('B start');
	return Promise.resolve();
}).then(function() {
	console.log('B finish');
});

// EXCLUSIVE lock functions
locker.lock(function C() {
	console.log('C start');
	return Promise.resolve();
}).then(function() {
	console.log('C finish');
});

locker.lock(function D() {
	console.log('D start');
	return Promise.resolve();
}).then(function() {
	console.log('D finish');
});

// More non-exclusive functions
locker.run(function E() {
	console.log('E start');
	return Promise.resolve();
}).then(function() {
	console.log('E finish');
});

locker.run(function F() {
	console.log('F start');
	return Promise.resolve();
}).then(function() {
	console.log('F finish');
});
```

This outputs:

```
A start
B start
A finish
B finish
C start
C finish
D start
D finish
E start
F start
E finish
F finish
```

`A` and `B` run concurrently as neither requires an exclusive lock.
`C` (exclusive) does not begin execution until both `A` and `B` have finished.
`D` (exclusive) does not begin execution until `C` has finished.
`E` and `F` do not begin execution until after `D` has finished.
`E` and `F` run concurrently as neither requires an exclusive lock.
